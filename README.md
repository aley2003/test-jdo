========

Template project for any user testcase using JDO.
To create a DataNucleus test simply fork this project, and add/edit as 
necessary to add your model and persistence commands. The files that you'll likely need to edit are

* src/main/java/mydomain/model/   **[Put your model classes here]**
* src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml   **[Put your datastore details in here]**
* src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/SimpleTest.java   **[Edit this if a single-thread test is required]**
* src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/MultithreadTest.java   **[Edit this if a multi-thread test is required]**

To run this, simply type "mvn clean compile test"
